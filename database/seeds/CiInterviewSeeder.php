Water?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE:  No, no let’s make this quick; I have other matters to attend to today.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Of course. As you know, the painting found hanging in your dining room was found to be a forgery by Malloy Restoration Services. We believe your paining was swapped with the forgery sometime during the evening of your house party.  \r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE:  So, it would seem.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Can you think of anything unusual that happened that evening?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE: (rolls eyes) Define unusual.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Well, was anyone acting nervous or unusual? Did anything out of the ordinary happen?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE:  Acting unusual? How about my entire family – my wife, my niece and nephew. All disappointments. I’m sure my wife is having an affair. My niece and nephew are sweet enough but hardly ambitious. My niece is in art school and has big dreams. She’s smart. I offered her a role in my company, she turned it down. My nephew can’t settle on an occupation but doesn’t see the need to work hard. I’ve told him I’m cutting his allowance until he makes a plan for his future. So, there’s been some family tension. \r\n\r\nAs for anything out of the ordinary; one of the guests, Charles Ives fainted. He was fine after sometime. Fortunately for him, my good friend Jerome Cambridge was in attendance. He is a physician and took care of Charles. He ordered all of us to bring Charles to the lounge to rest. Charles rested in the lounge and was able to rejoin us later on in the evening. Other than that, I have nothing.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Please don’t take my next question in a bad way. Please understand, I must ask. How has business been lately?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE:  How can I not take offense?! Look, we’ve hit a bit of a rough patch. My partner Mason Jarvis and I are not seeing eye to eye on business. We’ve taken a couple losses this year and have had to make decisions about how to manage the business moving forward. We have taken loans we owe money on. But why would I steal my own painting to collect the insurance? I can just sell the painting. Don’t believe what my wife says! I’m not in competition with my friends at the yacht and country clubs like she says!\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I didn’t know that is her belief. I suppose you just answered my next question, but can you think of anyone that would want to frame you for the theft?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE: (laugh) My wife would love to see me fail. My niece and nephew aren’t happy I am cutting their allowances until they shape up. Maybe my business partner Mason would like to frame me too so he could just take over my share of the company, maybe even sell it and retire. What do I know? Look, are we done? I have a business meeting to attend.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay, Mr. Pembroke, you are free to leave. We will be in touch. Oh! One more thing. We don’t have a warrant yet, but you won’t mind us looking into your house, would you?\r\n\r\nMr. PEMBROKE:  I have nothing to hide. You have my permission to search my house.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Thank you. I appreciate your cooperation.',

I have just a few questions.\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  Ask away.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  On the night of the theft during the house party, did you notice anything unusual from anyone at the party?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  I don’t know. I try to stay buzzed during my husband’s parties. It keeps things more interesting.  \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I take it you and Mr. Pembroke are having issues?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  My husband works nonstop and is full of himself, constantly trying to impress people. It’s a bit much.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Fair enough. But back to my question, did you observe anyone behaving in an unusual manner?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  My husband was irritated most of the night, but shows a smiling face during pictures. That’s fairly normal, I suppose. My niece wouldn’t stop yapping about the painting, and the painter. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  You seem to have come to the mansion way earlier than others. Any specific reason?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  That’s true. I come early to let the house helpers enter the mansion and do the preparations for the party.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  We understand Charles Ives is the esteemed art professor at your niece’s art school. Was he invited to the party by her?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  Yes. My niece is a very ambitious girl. She hoped to impress Professor Ives by inviting him to our extravagant party and believed he would thoroughly enjoy the painting by Forester Snow as much as she. Professor Ives is a contemporary art professor and accomplished painter himself. I know she was looking to enter his professional circle. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Fair enough. Now you work as a criminal defense attorney?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  Correct. (smirking face) I suppose you are suggesting I would know how to commit a crime without getting caught?\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  (shaking head no) I would suggest no such thing. But Mrs. Pembroke, you do concede you and your husband are having marital issues. Are you also having financial issues?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  I know you are just doing your job, but I find your questions insulting. I do plan to start my own law firm, so hopefully things will get better.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Fair enough. Okay Mrs., Pembroke, thank you for your time. We will be in touch. Oh! One more thing. We don’t have a warrant yet, but you won’t mind us looking into your house, would you?\r\n\r\nMrs. PEMBROKE:  Sure. You can do that if you wish to.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Thank you!',

	            'interview' => 'INSPECTOR:  Professor Ives, thank you for meeting us here. We know you’re a busy man. We have some questions regarding the night the painting was stolen from the Pembroke Mansion. \r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I understand.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  We understand it was quite the evening for you! Tell us what happened in regards to your fainting spell.\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I’m not sure there’s much to tell. We’d finished coffee and dessert. I stood up like the rest. I’d been talking to Mr. Pembroke over dessert and we were planning to continue our conversation when all a sudden I felt faint and collapsed.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  What had you two been discussing?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I can’t recall. I think he was telling me about the history of the mansion. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Okay so what happened next? You fainted, then what?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I recall being moved to the lounge. Dr. Cambridge inquired about my health. My fainting spell was rather strange. I’d never experienced it before. But I have no allergies or medical problems I’m aware of. Maybe overexertion? I have a very busy lecture schedule this semester, consult for several museums, and have had to travel quite a bit. The doctor chalked it up to fatigue and ordered me to rest, which I did.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Yes, Dr. Cambridge mentioned you received a text after you were brought into the lounge. Was it work related? Did you respond?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  Yes, work related, as usual (rolls eyes). No, I didn’t answer it and rested as Dr. Cambridge advised.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  When did you rejoin the guests?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES: (thinks) I don’t know the exact time. It could have been 15-20 mins later. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Do you recall what happened when you rejoined the guests?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  Well, the party was going as usual until Amanda ran towards me frantic telling me the painting…the same painting we’d been looking at all night was a forgery. I of course conceded the painting on the wall was suspicious and should be tested by a lab to verify.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  How well do you know Amanda Pembroke?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  Not that well, actually. She is a graduate student at the university in which I teach. I’ve heard a lot about her on campus from my faculty colleagues, and other students. She is seen as obsessed with the painter, Forester Snow. I’ve heard, but of course cannot verify, that she has spent her graduate stipend trying to locate Snow, who has been reclusive since his major piece sold more than 2 decades ago.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: (shakes head in disbelief) Fascinating. You don’t know her well, have you any idea why she invited you to the party that evening?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  My best guess? She is trying to build her network and gain entry into my circle of artworld connections. I was surprised when she approached me, but admit, I was thrilled to be invited to see the original painting. Modern art is my specialty; it’s not uncommon for me to get invited to events by individuals I don’t know well, or at all. I have had modest success in my own right as a painter, and have authored numerous publications in the field of modern art…not to brag (grins)\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Hey, if it’s true, it isn’t bragging! (grins) Professor Ives, since you barely know Amanda, is it also true you had never previously met any of the other guests, including her family before?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I met Daniel and Marcia once previously.  I was trying to get the Black Square during its auction and they outbid me. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Do you think it’s possible Amanda had something to do with the theft?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I hate to think of anyone doing such a thing. I don’t know her that well, but I suppose it’s possible. Maybe she was trying to impress me. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I notice that you are wearing gloves. Do you always wear them?\r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  I have dry skin lately (damn weather!). So, I have been wearing them, especially when I go outside my house.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Okay, well thank you for your time, professor. One more thing. May we permission to search your home for the missing paining? It’s merely a formality and would save us the hassle of getting a warrant. \r\n\r\nProf. IVES:  (Laughs) You can search my house. I would like to stay with you when you do that though as I don’t want your people to be spoiling my paintings! \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Not a problem professor. You may be present during the search. Thank you, Professor.',

As you were one of the guests at your uncles’ house party the night of the theft, we have a few questions.\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  I understand\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Excellent. You are in art school, correct?\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  That’s right. I hope to obtain a high-profile position in an esteemed museum someday or start my own business. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  It sounds like you have big dreams. How well do you know Professor Charles Ives?\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  He is a professor of modern art in the same university I attend, and has had some success selling his work and has many connections that could be helpful to me in my future. My aunt Marcia agreed to me inviting him, but I think more because he’s is a local celebrity and she could get good press coverage when Ms. Abernathy would report our event in the local newspaper, rather than to help me.  \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Witnesses say you are the one that called out the painting in the dining room being a forgery.\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  That’s true.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Impressive from a young art student.\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  I don’t know what you’re implying.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Witnesses have described you as obsessed with the painting. You were observed looking at it at close range for long periods of time and engaging the professor in conversations about the painter.\r\n\r\nAMANDA: (Becomes flustered) Yes, that’s true, but I’m not obsessed! I’m writing my dissertation on the painter, Forester Snow. I’m focusing my specialty in modern art too. It is my dream to work in a museum and help curate works. I must become an expert to do that! And yes, I happened to notice the signature of the artist, Forester Snow looked different. I shared my suspicions with the professor!\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  How did he react?\r\n\r\nAMANDA: He seemed a bit annoyed. Like I’m some obnoxious student trying to show how smart I am. He agreed it was a forgery, but seemed reluctant. Probably he was mad I noticed it and he didn’t.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  And at what time did you discover this?\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  I don’t remember the exact time but sometime around 11pm, and that’s when we called the police.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Miss. Blackburn, was anyone acting out of the ordinary? \r\n\r\nAMANDA: Well, just the usual tension between my aunt and uncle. And between my brother and uncle. But my brother wasn’t involved, I’m sure of it. Our uncle is really hard on Brandon and me. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Isn’t it true your parents were arrested and convicted of embezzling money when you and Brandon were 14 and 16, respectively.\r\n\r\nAMANDA: (rolls eyes). Yes. So what? My uncle Daniel was thrilled to take over my parents remaining assets and our island retreat, which he made into his party mansion. He was less thrilled about being our guardians.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  It sounds like you have a grudge against your uncle. He got to take over your house and your parents remaining assets and seems to relish in keeping you and your brother on a short financial leash. And by your own admission, he’s hard on you and your brother. If I were you, I’d want to get back at him.\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  I didn’t steal his precious painting! I don’t need to do that! I’m going to make it big without him. I don’t know how the painting was seemingly hanging in the dining room wall one minute and replaced by an obvious forgery. But that’s your job, why don’t you stop picking on me and figure it out.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Alright Miss Pembroke. Thank you for your time today. Just a heads up. Your aunt and uncle have given us permission to search all the family residences for the stolen painting.\r\n\r\nAMANDA:  I’ll try not to be insulted. I have nothing to hide so search away! \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Thank you!',

We have just a few questions about the night the painting went missing at your uncle’s mansion.\r\n\r\nBRANDON: (Shrug) Okay, but I think you mean my parents’ mansion.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Sounds like you have a grudge against your uncle?\r\n\r\nBRANDON: (Sarcastic) Oh, I don’t know. He gets to take over my parents remaining assets, withholds money rightfully belonging to my sister and me, brags about his big business, which is obviously failing, and throws big parties at my mansion. He complains I never do anything but never once has he helped me. My parents made a mistake, they didn’t intentionally embezzle, they had a crappy accountant. Uncle Daniel knows this but saw an opportunity to take advantage of my family. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Brandon, what do you do for living? \r\n\r\nBRANDON: (Silent for few seconds) Well, I didn’t need to do anything if my Uncle had not taken over my parent’s property. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay. So how do you survive now since your uncle has your parent’s property? \r\n\r\nBRANDON: I get a monthly payment from the trust setup by my parents. My Uncle administers that.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I see. Though I hear your uncle will be stopping those payments. And if your uncle and aunt get caught in some criminal activity, who owns the property? \r\n\r\nBRANDON:  I am not a lawyer so don’t know all the details, but I think it would come to my sister and me as we don’t have any other close relative. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Thanks Brandon. Did you happen to notice your sister acting strange during the party?\r\n\r\nBRANDON: (shocked) Amanda? No. I mean she wouldn’t shut up about the painter guy but basically all she talks about is art these days. I think a lot of people were annoyed but I didn’t care. I was mostly focused on my girlfriend, Sarah Abernathy.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  The party photographer?\r\n\r\nBRANDON: Yeah.  (smirks) My uncle insisted on having the party documented and was willing to pay to have a story about the party at Walnut Grove Mansion published in the newspaper. I told him I know a photographer and journalist at the local newspaper and could arrange for her to cover the story. To my surprise he didn’t argue with me. (Smirks again). I just thought the world should see how dysfunctional my family is.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  (laughs) You’re quite a comedian, Brandon. Is there anyone that stands out to you that could possibly be involved in the theft of your uncle’s painting?\r\n\r\nBRANDON:  Well, I wouldn’t rule out my uncle to do something like this. Possibly his business partner Mason Jarvis. I overheard them arguing a few weeks over money lost in the business. My uncle was furious Mason took a loan without telling him, claiming the terms were terrible. I’d also say my cold Aunt Marcia. She’s been unhappy with my uncle for a while. Maybe she stole it and is planning to use the money to leave my uncle. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay Brandon, I think that’s all our questions for now. Just a heads up, your Uncle and Aunt have given us permission to search all your residences. \r\n\r\nBRANDON:  Whatever, bro. I’ve got nothing to hide.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Thank you!',

Brandon didn’t want me to meet his other family. They have a strained relationship and I don’t even think they are aware I’m his girlfriend. I hadn’t met any other guests at the party before that night.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Has Brandon ever talked to you about his relationship with his aunt and uncle or his parents?\r\n\r\nSARAH ABERNATHY:  Well, I mean he was devastated when his parents were sent to jail when he was 16. He believes they made a simple mistake and are innocent. His uncle is hard on him, his aunt is cold and distant. He says both are fixated on themselves and don’t help him or Amanda financially or otherwise.

We understand one of the guests, professor Charles Ives fainted at some point. Can you tell us a little about that?\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE:  Well, it was around 9:00 pm. We had just finished our coffee and dessert. We all stood up to mingle in groups when the professor collapsed. I checked his vitals. I asked for the rest of the parties help in moving him to the lounge so I could better assess his situation. I recall asking Daniel to get a glass of water for the man, which he did. While Professor Ives took the water, I questioned him about his health – did he have any food allergies or any medical condition that could explain why he fainted. He said none he was aware of. He received a text and seemed agitated, and told us it was probably work related – he said he’s been quite busy at the University. I instructed him to ignore it and rest. His episode did seem a bit out of the ordinary but because his vitals were fine and he was having no trouble communicating, I suggested he take rest in the lounge and rejoin us after sometime. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Lucky for Charles Ives there was a doctor in the house! Can you describe what happened next?\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE:  Well, we closed the lounge room doors and retreated back to the dining area. The professor rejoined us, about 15 or 20 minutes later. He seemed normal by then. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: How long have you known Daniel Pembroke?\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE:  I’d say roughly 10 years? We are neighbors and belong to the same sailing club. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: Has he ever spoken about his business? Possible marital difficulties? I think you know what I’m getting at and I’m sorry to ask, but it is my job.\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE:  Look, business has been tough lately. Daniel is old fashioned and technology is rapidly changing the business. His partner, Mason is considerably younger and feels he can and should upgrade to meet the changing market. They’ve had some fights recently. As for his marriage, I’ll say both Daniel and Marcia are incredibly driven and career oriented. Daniel has had his suspicions for a while but honestly, Marcia would be well within her reason to have suspicions too. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: How about his relationship with his niece and nephew?\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE:  Daniel is a good man but incredibly tough on his family and that includes his niece and nephew. He wants Amanda to abandon her ideas and join his company – she’s very talented and he’d be happy to have her work on marketing and advertising. Brandon is smart, but unlike Amanda lacks focus. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: You know the situation well and the family well. Do you think anyone in the family could have done this? Or, were any of the other guests acting in way that makes you think they may have played a role.\r\n\r\nDr. CAMBRIDGE: (Smiles) Medicine is my specialty. I think I’ll stick to that and let you make the call on this one.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: (Laughs) Fair enough.

As you were a guest at Mr. Pembroke’s dinner party the other night, we do have a few questions related to the painting theft. \r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  That’s fine.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  How long have you been in business with Mr. Pembroke?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  We started our company almost 10 years ago. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  We understand there has been tension between the two of you recently; can you shed some light on this?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS: (annoyed) Shed some light on this? I’ll give it to you straight: the times are changing and Daniel is a dinosaur! He refuses to upgrade to even the most basic technology platforms to keep our business competitive. I have a background in using technology for marketing and advertising and I can do the upgrades myself! Daniel won’t budge…he’s too worried. With the marketplace changing we’ve fallen behind our competitors and as such, then business has taken a major hit. Daniel is too proud; I want to save the company so took out a loan. When I got around to telling Daniel a few weeks ago, he was furious and claims I can’t negotiate business and we’ll have to pay interest we cannot afford. So yes, there’s been tension recently. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Enough tension to say, steal a painting to sell and recoup personal losses? \r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS: I find that question insulting! I didn’t steal the painting! If you think I did, go prove it!\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR: (calming voice) take it easy, Mr. Jarvis. It’s just a question. What kind of busines do you and Daniel run?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS: (calming down) We buy and sell art, primarily to hotels. That’s where most of our revenue comes from. I’ve told Daniel we should use our profits to branch out and restore artwork. Daniel thinks my venture would drain company funds. That’s what our big fight was about recently because I took out a loan to help branch out in this area without his approval. But I’ve got friends I trust in the industry and I say it’s a risk worth taking that could give our company more publicity.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  So, if someone has to create a fake painting of a popular artist, you have contacts capable of doing that? \r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  It is possible, but I wouldn’t do it. It would be illegal.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay. Do you recall Professor Charles Ives fainting that evening?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  Yes\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Do you recall approximately when he fainted, and what happened next?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  We’d just finished coffee and dessert. Professor Ives stood, and a moment later collapsed around 9pm. Dr. Cambridge looked at him and ordered us to help move the professor into the lounge. Daniel left to get him some water.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Do you recall how long Daniel was out of the room?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  No. Maybe 5 minutes? I’m not entirely sure. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Do recall anyone else leaving the room? Anyone missing from the room?\r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS:  I remember standing next to Brandon and Miss Abernathy, the photographer. So, they didn’t leave. Oh yes, Marica left for restroom; I don’t recall if anyone was missing from the room. Marcia later joined us when we went back to the dining room.  \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Alright Mr. Jarvis, we won’t take any more of your time. One more thing. Although we don’t have a warrant yet, but you won’t mind us looking into your house. Would you? \r\n\r\nMASON JARVIS: No problem to me. Do it whenever you want to.',

We have some questions regarding the night the painting was stolen from the Mansion. \r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  I understand.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  First, can you tell me how you got hired as a housekeeper of the family? \r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  Marcia has been defending my husband for a criminal case for few years. We lost the case last year, which sent my husband to jail. But Marcia hired me as their housekeeper.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Oh wait. So, Marcia knows that your husband is a criminal and still hired you for housekeeping?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  My husband is not a criminal. He was wrongly accused of a burglary. Marcia tried to defend him, but our bad luck, she couldn’t. She knew that my husband was not guilty and I had no source of income. Thus, I think as a sympathy she hired me. She is a nice woman and I really respect her.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Who paid Marcia for defending your husband? Lawyers fee could be a lot.\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  She is a nice woman and took our case pro bono. She defends a lot of low-income cases for nothing in return.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay. Has she ever asked you to do anything unusual?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  No, nothing. She asked me to come a little early to the mansion to help clean it up for the party. But I think that would be normal given she was hosting a party that evening. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did you attend the whole party?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  No. I left early around 8:30.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Have you been to the mansion before?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  No. I usually work at their residence. Marcia asked me to come to the mansion for the first time.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did she give you any big box before leaving the mansion?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  Yes, she did and asked me to just keep it at my place, and bring it to their residence once she asks me to.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did you look into what it is?\r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  No, I didn’t. It’s none of my concern. I don’t think it’s appropriate to snoop through my employer’s things. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  May we search your house? This is routine. We’re asking everyone that was at the mansion that night. Otherwise, we can get a warrant. \r\n\r\nCLAIRE:  You don’t need to threaten me. I’ve nothing to hide.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Thank you, Claire. You have been very helpful.',

Ask me what you have to.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  First, tell me what were you doing in the mansion on the day of party? \r\n\r\nTIM:  I’m a house painter. So, isn’t it obvious that I was asked to make some patch ups in the mansion to make it look neat and tidy for the party? That’s what I did there.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did you paint the whole mansion?\r\n\r\nTIM:  No way. That would take at least a few days. I just painted a few patches on the ceiling, old sconces and the outside walls.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Won’t the paint smell during the party?\r\n\r\nTIM:  No. I use odorless paint. So, no guest would know if something was painted. The paint was also on the areas where nobody would usually touch, so it was all safe.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Okay. You have some criminal record and have stolen things from houses before. What time did you leave the mansion?\r\n\r\nTIM: (annoyed) I left probably around 7:30 pm. Look officer. I have done bad things before, but I have been penalized for that. I am clean now, I have a good job, and don’t steal anymore.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did anyone check your car before you leave the mansion?\r\n\r\nTIM:  Not that I am aware of.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I would need to search your house. If you want a warrant, let me know and we will get it. You know we can get it easily against you, considering your history.\r\n\r\nTIM:  Go ahead officer. I only request to stay in when the search happens, so that your people don’t plant anything against me.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  That’s fair. Thanks.',

We have few questions about the Walnut Grove Mansion party, if you don’t mind.  \r\n\r\nCARLOS:  No worries at all. Go ahead inspector.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Tell me how you got the job to be the chef for the party? \r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Mr. Pembroke has seen me in some other parties he has attended. He called me a week before January 15 and asked if I could be their chef. I was actually very busy and didn’t have time, but then he offered me much higher price to be there. I was luckily able to make some adjustments and accepted it.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  And what’s your specialty in cooking?\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Seafood!\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Nice. I assume Mr. Pembroke also likes seafood?\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Actually no. He is a vegetarian. He asked me to prepare seafood for the party, and a few vegetarian dishes as he and the Professor are vegetarians. \r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Interesting. Did you serve the food to the guests that evening?\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Yes, I did, but I couldn’t stay for the whole party because I had to leave for another engagement. Mr. Pembroke let me go before 9 pm.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Was dinner over by that time?\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Yes. People were just chatting and drinking after dinner.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  Did anyone check your car before you leave the mansion?\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  Not at all. There was no reason to do that.\r\n\r\nINSPECTOR:  I hope you won’t mind me searching your house. We don’t have a warrant yet, but let me know if you need it.\r\n\r\nCARLOS:  No problem inspector.
